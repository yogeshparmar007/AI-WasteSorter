# Project Title
Smart Waste Sorter â€“ Building AI course project

## Summary
This project proposes an AI-powered waste sorting system that uses image recognition to automatically identify recyclable materials from waste streams. The system aims to reduce landfill waste and improve recycling efficiency in cities and industries.

## Background
* Problem: Manual waste sorting is slow, unsafe, and inefficient.
* Frequency: Urban areas produce tons of waste daily, much of which goes unsorted.
* Motivation: Inspired by environmental sustainability and automation possibilities.
* Importance: Automated waste sorting helps reduce human risk and boosts recycling rates.

## How is it used?
Users install smart cameras on waste-sorting belts. The AI model identifies plastic, glass, paper, and metals, and robotic arms sort them accordingly.  
Used by:
* Recycling plants
* Municipal waste management systems
* Industrial facilities

## Data sources and AI methods
* Dataset: Images of different waste materials (can use [TrashNet Dataset](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet))
* Methods: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Image classification, supervised learning
* Tools: Python, TensorFlow or PyTorch, OpenCV

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| Input | Waste image |
| Output | Classified material type |
| Model | CNN trained on labeled waste images |

## Challenges
* Limited labeled data for specific waste types
* Real-world lighting and camera angle variations
* Ethical concerns: job displacement in manual sorting

## What next?
Future improvements:
* Deploy model on low-power edge devices
* Train on more diverse global waste data
* Partner with municipalities for real-world testing
